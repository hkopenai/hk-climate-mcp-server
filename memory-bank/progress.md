# Progress

## What Works
- All core weather data tools implemented:
  - Current weather observations
  - 9-day weather forecasts
  - Weather warnings and alerts
  - Special weather tips
- Both stdio and SSE transport modes supported
- Language support for English, Traditional and Simplified Chinese

## What's Left to Build
- Caching layer for HKO API responses
- Rate limiting implementation
- Implement new data sources:
  - Tidal data (astronomical tides, high/low tides)
  - Sun/moon times (sunrise/sunset, moonrise/moonset)
  - Lightning data
  - Visibility data
  - Temperature data (mean, max, min)
  - Weather and radiation reports

## Current Status
- Core functionality complete and operational
- Documentation being finalized
- Ready for production deployment

## Known Issues
- No caching means repeated API calls to HKO
- No rate limiting implemented yet
- Limited error handling for HKO API failures
- New data sources not yet implemented

## Evolution of Decisions
- Originally planned database caching → Changed to direct API calls
- Initially only stdio mode → Added SSE support
- Started with English only → Added Chinese language support
